The MRI Ruby implementation supports heavy weight threads which are
pre-emptively scheduled, and lightweight fibres which may run on those
threads and are co-operatively scheduled. Fibres have been a problem
for JVM Ruby implementations because the VM itself did not have a
concept of a fibre, or a lightweight abstraction we could build upon,
but that's starting to change with <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/">Project loom</a>, let's take a look at
what it gives, and how we can use that to implement fibres that can
scale beyond even MRI's.

Everything I"m talking about here is based on early prototypes. The
APIs and features may change radically before anything nears being
production, and there is no fixed timetable for when these feature
will arrive in a production JVM except, "When it's done." I
contributed the support for Graal to Loom, and implemented the
prototype we'll talk about here for TruffleRuby.

<p>
Project Loom is an OpenJDK project with the goal
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To explore and incubate Java VM features and APIs built on top of them
for the implementation of lightweight user-mode threads (fibres),
delimited continuations (of some form), and related features, such as
explicit tail-call.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That may sound complex, but let's look at it bit by bit and see what
it gives us in Java, and how we can use that in TruffleRuby.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org884ea0f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org884ea0f"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Lightweight user mode threads</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
These are currently called <code>java.lang.Fiber</code> in the project loom
prototype, and they provide a nice simple model. Fibres are started
with a scheduler, and whenever the has nothing to do it parks
itself. When the scheduler decided that that fibre has more work it
can do then it will schedule it next. The scheduler isn't special,
it's a standard <code>java.util.concurrent.Executor</code> and it can use
whatever scheduling strategy it likes, across as many threads as it
likes. If your fibres are mostly doing IO, or waiting for locks then
you probably won't even have to park them explicitly as the Java class
library will do that for you.

<h3 id="org1e53811"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Continuations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Continuations are a lower level concept upon which those lightweight
threads are built. A continuation can be run, and can yield control
back to the function which ran it. If it is run again then it will
continue from the point at which it yielded with the same call stack,
local variables, and so forth.

<h3 id="org2c14945"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> What makes these features more light weight than <code>java.lang.Thread</code>?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
A normal <code>java.lang.Thread</code> in Hotspot is a normal operating system
thread, it has a stack, and will be scheduled by the operating system,
and in the JVM it will include data structures for things like thread
local variables. Scheduling threads is heavyweight because it has to
happen via kernel space and because the kernel only has a very limited
idea of which thread it would be sensible to schedule
next. Lightweight user mode threads and continuations can involve much
less data since we only need to preserve the part of the stack between
the call to run the continuation and the point at which it yielded,
and can often be very effectively scheduled since the application may
often know precisely what to run next.

<h2 id="org4b2d5b2"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Fibres and continuations in Ruby</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Ruby has its own model of fibres and continuations, and they aren't
quite the same as Loom's
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgff843fc" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgff843fc"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Fibres</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Ruby has the <code>Fiber</code> class. You create a <code>Fiber</code> with a block like this
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">f = Fiber.new do |x|
  puts "Fiber called with #{x}"
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
and call it like this
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">f.resume(1)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which should produce <code>Fiber called with 1</code> as output. Fibres can
explicitly transfer control to another fibre, or yield to the fibre
which transferred control to them.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga248bc2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga248bc2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Continuations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Continuations in Ruby are created using the <code>Kernel#callcc</code>
method. This takes a block which will be executed immediately, and
create a continuation object which when called will resume execution
from the end of the block. They are quite hard to get your head round,
so an example is probably helpful. I've adapted this one from the Ruby
documentation on continuations.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">require "continuation"
def f
  arr = [ "Freddie", "Herbie", "Ron", "Max", "Ringo" ]
  cont = nil
  callcc do |cc| 
    puts 'Creating continuation'
    cont = cc
  end
  puts(message = arr.shift)
  cont.call unless message =~ /Max/
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you run this Ruby method it will output the following
</p>
<pre class="example">
Creating continuation
Freddie
Herbie
Ron
Max

</pre>
<p>
What's going on here? Well the method creates an array <code>arr</code>, and a
variable <code>cont</code>. It then calls <code>callcc</code> which executes the block,
passing in the continuation object as an argument. The block prints
out that we're creating a continuation, and assigns it to <code>cont</code> so we
can use it later. We then remove the first element of <code>arr</code> and assign
it to <code>message</code> and output it. Finally we call the continuation again
unless <code>message</code> matches "Max", and this causes the latter half of the
method to be run again.
</p>

<p>
There's quite a lot of debate over whether continuations like this are
a good idea, and they certainly aren't widely used in production code,
but they are still part of the standard Ruby implementation and we do
support them in TruffleRuby.

<h2 id="org4d9c9d8"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> The differences between these two models</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
As you can see these models differ in a couple of important ways.
</p>

<p>
In the case of fibres Loom places the responsibility for scheduling on
an object outside of the fibres themselves, while Ruby allows each
fibre to either explicitly transfer control to another or yield to
whichever fibre transferred control to it.
</p>

<p>
Continuations are even more marked in their differences. Loom's behave
in many ways more like Ruby's fibres, with each call and yield
advancing the execution state.

<h2 id="org115439b"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Implementing Ruby's model using Loom's</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
So given the quite different nature of these two models can we
implement Ruby's fibres and continuations using what Loom provides?
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org38dda0c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org38dda0c"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Implementing Ruby fibres</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Most of the code in TruffleRuby concerned with fibres is in a small
set of classes, mainly <code>FiberManager</code> which handles the creation of
fibres and how control is passed between them. This makes it quite
easy for us to prototype new implementations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org10895f7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org10895f7"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.1</span> With Loom's Fibres</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">
<p>
Could we simply replace the use of threads in <code>FiberManager</code> with
fibres? Well, we'd need a scheduler that could cope with both the
explicit yielding from a Ruby <code>Fiber</code> and other parts of the Java
class library park fibres for their own reasons. This is certainly an
approach worth investigating, but Loom's fibre API is one area most
likely to change, so we'll leave that attempt till later.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org59b1a7e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org59b1a7e"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.2</span> With Loom's Continuations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
Loom's continuations seem like a much better fit. The <code>FiberManager</code>
can represent Ruby <code>Fiber</code> with a <code>java.lang.Continution</code>, and
orchestrate the transfer of control between them. Execution can
process roughly as follows:
</p>
</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org29c3ad9"></a>Creating a <code>Fiber</code><br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-2-1">
<p>
This should create a <code>java.lang.Continuation</code> which will do the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fetch any arguments given to the fibre.</li>
<li>Set itself as the current fibre.</li>
<li>Run the provided code block.</li>
<li>Clean up and tell the <code>FiberManager</code> what should be run next.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The fibre won't be run immediately, that can happen when
<code>Fiber#resume</code> is called.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org6b91998"></a>Transferring control from the thread into a <code>Fiber</code><br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-2-2">
<p>
The <code>FiberManager</code> needs to set any arguments to the fibre, and then
run the continuation representing it. When control returns back to the
<code>FiberManager</code> it should check what to schedule next.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgd24e3ca"></a>Transferring control from one <code>FIber</code> to another.<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-2-3">
<p>
The running fibre should set the next fibre to be run on the
<code>FiberManager</code>, set any arguments for it, and then yield. Control will
pass back to the <code>FiberManager</code> which should run the continuation for
the scheduled fibre. That fibre will then set itself as the current
fibre on the <code>FiberManager</code>, and get any arguments.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org29ef301"></a>Transferring control from a <code>Fiber</code> to the thread.<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-1-2-4">
<p>
This is much like the above case, except the <code>FiberManager</code> will not
run another continuation, instead it will simply return the results to
its original caller.
</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org490ba41" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org490ba41"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Implementing <code>callcc</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
<code>callcc</code> is harder to map to Loom's fibres or continuations, at least
at the moment. If the continuations can be cloned however then it
could be done roughly as follows. Each heavyweight thread would need
to be run almost entirely inside a <code>java.lang.Continuation</code>, and the
control flow would go like this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Creating the continuation.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a Ruby <code>Continuation</code> object.</li>
<li>Execute the block passed to <code>callcc</code> passing the Ruby continuation in.</li>
<li>Place the Ruby continuation somewhere the thread can access it.</li>
<li>Yield control to the thread.</li>
<li>The thread clones the main <code>java.lang.Continuation</code> and sets it
on the Ruby continuation object.</li>
<li>The thread returns control to the original <code>java.lang.Continuation</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Calling the continuation.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Place the Ruby continuation somewhere the thread can access it.</li>
<li>Yield control to the thread.</li>
<li>The thread clones the <code>java.lang.Continuation</code> on the Ruby
continuation.</li>
<li>The thread returns control to this new cloned continuation.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="org7e652d7"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> The results</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
So, having implemented a prototype for TruffleRuby the question is,
how well does it work? The tests we can run at the moment are a little
limited as the Loom prototype has some limitations, but it's enough to
test a few things.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1152fff" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1152fff"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> How many fibres can we support?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
It's very easy to support a large number of fibres if they are simply
initialised but never used, so we want a test that will create a large
set of fibres which are active. Something like this should do.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">def test_fiber_1(t)
  Fiber.new do |x|
    if x &gt; t
      Fiber.yield x
    else
      f = test_fiber_1(t)
      f.transfer( x + 1 )
    end
  end
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Using this code I ran some tests to see how many fibres could be
supported by different implementations. This was done by making an
initial guess and then performing a binary search to find the
approximate number of fibres that could be supported without raising
an error, or causing the VM to crash completely. MRI 2.5 has made
changes to its fibre code and can now support a larger number of
fibres. I'll update these results with figures for MRI 2.5 soon.
</p>

<p>
These results are very encouraging. The only real limit to the number
of fibres we can support appears to be memory.
</p>

<p>
Testing the performance of this is not easy with JRuby or TruffleRuby
using threads as neither can clean up threads fast enough to run the
test multiple times with large numbers of threads. We can however
compare TruffleRuby with continuations to MRI 2.4. The test was run
with 10000 fibres 20 times fibres to allow for warm up, and then
another 20 times to collect timings.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
Another thing to test is how fast it is to transfer control from one
fibre to another. We'll use a very small test which will be completely
dominated by the transfer time. Here is the source for this test.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">def create_fibers(t)
  fibers = []
  0...t.times do
    fibers &lt;&lt; Fiber.new do |x|

        f = fibers[rand(t)]
        Fiber.yield(f)

  fibers
end

def schedule_fibers(t, n)
  fibers = create_fibers(t)
  next_fiber = fibers.first
  0...(n * t).times do
    next_fiber = next_fiber.resume
  end
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will create <code>t</code> fibres and transfer control among them <code>t * n</code>
times. I had hoped to test this with large numbers of fibres, but
again encountered issues with running the test using JRuby or
TruffleRuby with threads, so tested with <code>t = 100</code> and <code>n = 1000</code>

<p>
As you can see, MRI beats all the other implementations easily, and
Loom's continuations still have a lot of work to be done on them
performance wise. Some experiments with varying the values of <code>t</code> and
<code>n</code> suggests that MRI's time is mostly spent creating the fibres, and
it's very quick to transfer control between them. All other
implementations are dominated by the time to transfer control between
fibres and have run times mostly unaffected by the total number of
fibres created (at least within the range I could test).
