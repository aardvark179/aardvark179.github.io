<h2 id="orge24c091"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Making special variables less special in TruffleRuby</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Ruby has quite a large set of <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/variable.html#variables">pre-defined global variables</a> which are
special in a variety of ways. Some are read only, some are only
defined when others are non-nil, some are local to a thread, and two
are really special. Understanding exactly how they behave is hard
because you can't normally look in just one place. In MRI for example
you may be able to find where the variables are defined in the C code,
but you'll also need to trace through many functions to track
down everything that happens, and you may find there is some special
code in the parser or compiler that changes that. In TruffleRuby we
like to implement as much as we can in Ruby, so let's see if we can do
that here and make it easier for everyone to understand how these
variables behave.
</p>

<p>
This sort of thing has been <a href="https://github.com/0x0dea/viva">done before</a> as a fun demo, but not for
actually implementing Ruby itself, even in implementations that try to
write as much of their standard library in Ruby as they can.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge101169" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge101169"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Hooked variables</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The most important thing we're going to need is a way to define
variables with custom behaviour from Ruby. There's a function in MRI's
C API which allows this, <code>rb_define_hooked_variable</code>, and several
macros and other variants that use that. Since we support those
function we already had the capability, but we do need to expose it in
a nice way. We don't want to add methods to existing classes that
might cause clashes so we tend to put things like this into modules
under the <code>Truffle</code> name space. We are also going to want to define a
lot of read only variables, so it's probably a good idea to make a
method for that as well. In TruffleRuby you'll find these methods in
<code>Truffle::KernelOperations</code>, but for brevity we'll just put them under
<code>Truffle</code> here.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">module Truffle
  def self.define_hooked_variable(name, getter, setter, defined = proc { 'global-variable' })
    # Work is done in here.
  end

  def self.define_read_only_global(name, getter)
    setter = -&gt; _ { raise NameError, "#{name} is a read-only variable." }
    define_hooked_variable(name, getter, setter)
  end
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This method is going to take the name of a variable to be defined,
procedures for getting and setting the value, and an optional
procedure to be used for <code>defined? $my_variable</code>. If you've never used
<code>defined?</code> in Ruby it's a little special. It returns the semantic
meaning of the expression that follows it. Simple expressions will
just return <code>'expression'</code>, method names will return <code>'method'</code>, and
so on. If you try <code>defined? $var</code> then you will get
<code>'global-variable'</code> if <code>$var</code> has been assigned to or <code>nil</code> if it
hasn't. Some of Ruby's special variables have more complex behaviour
so we need to be able to provide a procedure for that.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgba261ab" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgba261ab"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Trivial example</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Let's see this in action by defining our own hooked variable.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">x = nil
Truffle.define_hooked_variable(
  :$my_var,
  -&gt; { x },
  -&gt; v { puts "Setting $my_var to #{v}.",
         x = v })
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now if you try doing <code>$my_var = "something"</code> you'll see a message
saying <code>Setting $my_var to something.</code> You should also be able to get
back the value you stored by doing <code>$my_var</code>. Now we know this works
let's see if we can define some of the simple special variables.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1683f88" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1683f88"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Variables related to ARGF</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Several special variables are connected to <code>ARGF</code>, they link to
properties on that object but can't be written to themselves.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_read_only_global :$&lt;, -&gt; { ARGF }
Truffle.define_read_only_global :$FILENAME, -&gt; { ARGF.filename }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There's also <code>$*</code> which holds the arguments not consumed by the Ruby implementation itself.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_read_only_global :$*, -&gt; { ARGV }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally we'll look at <code>$.</code>. This is set by various methods on <code>ARGF</code>
and file objects, but it's not actually <code>ARGF.lineno</code> since updating
it doesn't actually change that value. Instead we hold it on another
instance variable on <code>ARGF</code> like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_hooked_variable(
  :$.,
  -&gt; { ARGF.instance_variable_get(:@last_lineno) },
  -&gt; value { value = Truffle::Type.coerce_to value, Fixnum, :to_int
             ARGF.instance_variable_set(:@last_lineno, value) } )
</pre>

<h3 id="orga0de5f2"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Other simple cases</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Quite a few variables allow writes to them, but include some extra
checks. At first glance, it appears we could simply represent these
constraints with a lambda. While this is a nice, clear solution in
Ruby, it unfortunately complicates parts of the TruffleRuby runtime
written in Java. To help keep things simple for both the Ruby and Java
parts of the runtime, we've added <code>Truffle.global_variable_get</code> and
<code>Truffle.global_variable_set</code>. and we can then use them like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_hooked_variable(
  :$stdout,
  -&gt; { Truffle.global_variable_get(:$stdout) },
  -&gt; v { raise TypeError, "$stdout must have a write method #{v.class} given." unless v.respond_to?(:write)
         Truffle.global_variable_set(:$stdout, v) })

alias $&gt; $stdout
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There's a few more like this, and I won't go through them all, but
they can all be done as nice simple Ruby.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9e0af79" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9e0af79"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> But will it optimise?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
All the variables I've mentioned so far have a few things in
common. They have relatively simple semantics, and they aren't used
that that often, or aren't likely to be a real performance
bottleneck. But later on we're going to look at some that are used
much more heavily and are more complex to implement, so let's talk
about what will optimise now.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd87293d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd87293d"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.1</span> A normal global</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-1">
<p>
What happens when we run a simple statement like <code>$foo</code> in
TruffleRuby? Well, that statement gets parsed into an AST (an Abstract
Syntax Tree). In this case the only node we need to think about in the
tree is a <code>ReadGlobalVariableNode</code>. When it is run it will look up the
storage for that variable and return the result. If it were used
inside a loop then it would only lookup the variable storage the first
time it was executed; subsequent executions would just return the
value from the storage. That should be retty fast, right?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1d7feb8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1d7feb8"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.2</span> Optimising for constant values</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">
<p>
Most global variables won't change their value, and we'd like be able
to assume those values really are constant if we can. So the storage
for each global includes a couple of extra bits of information. We
keep track of the number of times a global has had its value changed,
and we keep an <code>Assumption</code> to represent the value being
constant. When code is compiled with a JIT (just in time) compiler
assumptions are often used to track speculative optimisations, and
marking an assumption as invalidated will cause the JIT to invalidate
the compiled code. So, how do we use this for global variables?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org339fd32" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org339fd32"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.3</span> Specialising</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-3">
<p>
<code>ReadGlobalVariableNode</code> is slightly more complex than I let on. It
actually has two specialisations which can be used.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java">@Specialization(assumptions = "storage.getUnchangedAssumption()")
public Object readConstant(
        @Cached("storage.getValue()") Object value) {
    return value;
}

@Specialization
public Object read() {
    return storage.getValue();
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
What this says is that if the assumption is true then we can cache the
value of the global, and return constant value without reading it from
storage every time. The JIT understands that the cached value is
constant, so can exploit that fact when making other optimisations. If
the variable is written to then that `Assumption` will be invalidated
and we'll fall back to getting the value from storage every time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd9bc0c4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd9bc0c4"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.4</span> But what about those hooked variables we just defined?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-4">
<p>
Once again <code>ReadGlobalVariableNode</code> is slightly more complex
than I let on. It also has cases for global variables with hooked
storage. It's not too bad though, because the hooks for a variable
must be constant, so we only really need to worry about how fast those
lambdas will run. Let's consider the lambda we defined
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">-&gt; { Truffle.global_variable_get :$stdout }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <code>global_variable_get</code> method is defined in our Java runtime, and
it has two specialisations. Let's take a look at the first one.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java">@Specialization(guards = "name == cachedName")
public Object read(DynamicObject name,
        @Cached("name") DynamicObject cachedName,
        @Cached("createReadNode(name)") ReadSimpleGlobalVariableNode readNode) {
    return readNode.execute();
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The first time the method is called we'll keep a reference to the name
of the variable we wanted to get, and we'll create a node to read the
value &mdash; it's a simple version of the node for reading globals that
doesn't care about any hooks. So as long as the symbol stays constant
all it will do is execute the read node. As long as the stored value
remains constant the read node will just return the cached value, and
the JIT can optimise away all the apparent extra work.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4eb6154" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4eb6154"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.5</span> Not so constant</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-5">
<p>
All that would be great if we only had that single lambda that did
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">-&gt; { Truffle.global_variable_get :$stdout }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
but we've also got
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">-&gt; { Truffle.global_variable_get :$stderr }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
and many others, so that symbol won't be constant any more, will it?
Luckily we have another tool we can use to help with that
problem: we can use a fresh copy of the <code>global_variable_get</code> method
everywhere it is used in the source. As long as the symbol is constant
at each of these call sites things should still work nicely.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5a9dd7d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5a9dd7d"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> There's special, and then there's special</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
Next up the difficulty ladder are variables which are local to a
thread. To implement <code>$SAFE</code> we'll need a way to return the value for
the current thread when it is read and written, as well as checking
any new value is valid. This value must not be visible in the normal
fiber local variables accessed using <code>Thread#[]</code> or the thread locals
accessed from <code>Thread#thread_variable_get</code>, so we'll need something on
<code>Truffle::ThreadOperations</code> to do that job.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_hooked_variable(
  :$SAFE,
  -&gt; { Truffle::ThreadOperations.get_thread_local(:$SAFE) },
  -&gt; value { value = Truffle::Type.check_safe_level(value)
             Truffle::ThreadOperations.set_thread_local(:$SAFE, value) }
)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The only new thing we have here is the ability to get or set a value on
the current thread. You might assume those methods have to be written in Java,
but they're written in Ruby as well. The get method looks something like
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">def self.get_thread_local(key)
  locals = thread_get_locals(Thread.current)
  object_ivar_get(locals, key)
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The values local to a thread are stored as a normal object with
instance variables, and we could have used
<code>Kernel#instance_variable_get</code> on locals, except <code>:$SAFE</code> isn't a
valid name for an instance variable in Ruby.
</p>

<p>
Everything here can be optimised in the same way I described
above. Accessing instance variables is extremely fast as long as the
owning object always has the same set of variables, and so as long as
the key stays constant it will just be a field access in an
object. <code>Thread.current</code> will be constant if you only use a single
thread, and getting the thread locals is just like getting an instance
variable. In reality you'll probably be using more than one thread,
but it should still optimise well if the method is copied for each
call site.
</p>

<p>
There's only a few other thread local variables, <code>$!</code> which holds the
last raised exception, <code>$?</code> which holds the return code of the last
child process, and <code>$@</code> which is just an alias for <code>$!.backtrace</code>. The
remaining ones I want to talk about are all connected with regular
expressions, and they are even more complex and subtle.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org63e7321" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org63e7321"><span class="section-number-3">1.7</span> &#x2026;and then there's really special</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
<code>$~</code> is more complex than you might realise. It holds the value of the
last regular expression match done in a variety of ways, and hence is
thread local. But more than that it is also frame local. What do I
mean by that? Well, try this code in <code>irb</code> and see what you get.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">def a(str)
  /foo/ =~ str
  $~
end

def b(str)
  a(str)
  $~
end

a("There is a foo in this string")
b("There is a foo in this string")
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The call to <code>a</code> will return a <code>MatchData</code> object, but the call to <code>b</code>
will return <code>nil</code>. Even setting <code>$~</code> in <code>a</code> won't affect the value we
see in <code>b</code>. It's pretty useful because no library call you make can
unexpectedly change the value of <code>$~</code> that you might be relying on, but
it is going to make our job implementing it harder.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org00f4e7d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org00f4e7d"><span class="section-number-4">1.7.1</span> Getting and setting the last match</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-1">
<p>
In our core library we need a way to reach up to the caller and set
the value of <code>$~</code> it sees in this thread, and we'll need to do
something similar for the variable hooks. What might a method for
accessing <code>$~</code> in a frame look like? Well we already have a way to
represent a frame in Ruby, <code>Binding</code>!
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">module Truffle
  module RegexpOperations
    def self.last_match(a_binding)
      Truffle.frame_local_variable_get(:$~, a_binding)
    end
  end
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<code>frame_local_variable_get</code> will access a hidden local variable in the
binding, and then pull out the thread local value stored in
there. That thread local storage is implemented in Java, and optimised
for the common case that it will only hold a value for one
thread.. The same kind of specialisations we're described above hold
true however for all these parts.
</p>

<p>
The variable we want (<code>$~</code>) is constant, accessing a variable in
<code>a_binding</code> can be optimized just like access to an instance variable
on an object, so the hard part is going to be ensuring that
<code>a_binding</code> always come from the same method or block. How can we
arrange that, and how can we pass a binding into a variable hook?
</p>

<p>
Well, we'll change how we handle variable hooks a
little. <code>ReadGlobalVariableNode</code> actually has two specialisations for
calling a hook, based on the arity of the hook procedure. If it
requires an argument then we'll pass in the binding where it has been
called, and we'll do something similar for write hooks. We'll also
mark the check when declaring the variable, and tell the runtime to
split the hooks for each call site if they take a binding.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8d4eb98" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-2">
<p>
With that in place <code>$~</code> can simply be defined as
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_hooked_variable(
  :$~,
  -&gt; b { Truffle::RegexpOperations.last_match(b) },
  -&gt; v, b { Truffle::RegexpOperations.set_last_match(v, b) })
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The core library will need to set <code>$~</code> in callers, and it can do this
with <code>set_last_match</code>. It needs to get the caller's binding but we
already have a mechanism to do that (it's how we implement
<code>Kernel#binding</code>) and it needs to optimise so we spot when it is
happening and automatically mark methods to be split.

<div id="outline-container-org2c13820" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2c13820"><span class="section-number-4">1.7.3</span> The other regexp variables</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-7-3">
<p>
Most of the other variables connected with regular expressions are
fairly simple. If the last match is not set then they will be <code>nil</code>,
and are not defined if you do <code>defined? $var</code>. Luckily this is quite
easy to represent using our <code>define_hooked_variable</code> method. For
example <code>$&amp;</code> is simply.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">Truffle.define_hooked_variable(
  :$&amp;,
  -&gt; b { match = Truffle::RegexpOperations.last_match(b)
         match[0] if match },
  -&gt; { raise SyntaxError, "Can't set variable $&amp;"},
  -&gt; b { 'global-variable' if Truffle::RegexpOperations.last_match(b) })
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Notice that we raise a <code>SyntaxError</code> when trying to set this variable
rather than the <code>NameError</code> other variables raise. It's just one of
the things that makes these variables extra special!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
Let's check global variable reads and hooked variable reads are still
good and fast. If you're wondering why I'm not testing writes it's
because they must introduce a full memory fence so the result can be
seen by other threads (see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pVzU8w_QF44YzUCCab990Q_WZOdhpKolCIHaiXG-sPw/edit#heading=h.bkpwfrblzkh">global variables section in the
proposed Ruby memory model</a> for details), and that really
dominates. Let's try a simple benchmark like
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">$var = 1
def simple_count
  total = 0
  10000.times do
    total += $var
  end
  total
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We'll run the benchmark on MRI, JRuby, and TruffleRubby, and we'll
also run it on TruffleRuby with <code>$var</code> defined as a hooked
variable. We do see some noise in these benchmarks and it take a few
seconds for TruffleRuby and JRuby's JITs to kick in, so I allow the
benchmarks to run for a few seconds and then took the average
iterations per second of this peak performance. All numbers have been
rounded to two siginificant figures.

What does this really tell us? Well, it tells us that we've worked out
<code>$var</code> is constant and we can still successfully do that when it's a
hooked variable, and maybe that has allowed the JIT to get really
aggressive with our test. Let's try making <code>$var</code> less constant and
see what happens.

<p>
So we ar seeing some slowdown, but we're still faster than other
implementations. The slowdown we see is quite sensitive to the precise
benchmark design. Some showed very little slowdown while this case has
is 3 times slower with hooked variables.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">
<p>
After this work there's only two special bits of variable support left
in our parser. We still look for <code>$1...$N</code> for accessing captured
group in <code>$~</code>. They would be trivial to implement in Ruby, but how
high is N? If we want to be exactly like MRI then there should be as
many variables as there are capture groups in a the regexp last match,
but only the first nine will be listed by
<code>Kernel#global_variables</code>. We might handle this by introducing a
<code>variable_missing</code> method that would be called if the global variable
storage has not already been declared, this could then create hooked
variables for captured group variables and normal storage for anything
else.
</p>

<p>
The other special handling we still have is for named captures. If you
use <code>=~</code> on a regexp literal, and it has named capture groups, then
the equivalently named local variables will be set to the capture
groups. We could write most of that in Ruby, but we'd still need to
check for named captures in the parser, and making sure it optimised
well would probably require some extra work that we haven't done yet.
</p>

<p>
Since we saw some slow down from hooked variables in performance
testing we may want to look more deeply into that and see if it can be
reduced or eliminated, and we migth look at rewriting the storage for
<code>$~</code> in Ruby as well.

<p>
TruffleRuby lets us implement more of Ruby in Ruby itself while still
allowing aggressive optimisation to be done. This can help make our
runtime smaller and hopefully make it easier for the community to
understand and contribute to our implementation.
