A few weeks ago we got a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/issues/1391">bug report</a> from <a href="https://github.com/gettalong">Thmoas Leitner</a> that <a href="https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/">HexaPDF</a>
wasn't working on TruffleRuby. HexaPDF is a pure Ruby library for
manipulating PDFs so any problems were clearly not to do with C
extensions or anything like that. So what wa wrong? HexaPDF uses a lot
of interesting Ruby features, and uses some in ways we don't see very
often, so it turns out it be an excellent way to find lots of
issues. Let's take a look at what we found and managed to fix.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org817e867" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org817e867"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Sorting arrays</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The first bug we found was caused by a test of array sorting. Ruby
doesn't guarantee exactly how your array will be sorted, except that
it will be done by performing some number of comparisons between
elements. On MRI this is really done by <code>qsort</code>, or a variant in the
C runtime library, but in TruffleRuby we o it ourselves, and may
change strategies depending on the size of the array. in the case of
the test the array <code>[c, b, a]</code> had to be sorted into the array <code>[a,
 b, c]</code>, and on MRI this was donee as follows:
</p>
<pre class="example">
b &lt;=&gt; a --&gt; [c, a, b]
c &lt;=&gt; a --&gt; [a, c, b]
c &lt;=&gt; b --&gt; [a, b, c]
</pre>
<p>
On TruffleRuby however the comparisons were as follows:
</p>
<pre class="example">
b &lt;=&gt; c --&gt; [b, c, a]
a &lt;=&gt; b --&gt; [a, c, b]
b &lt;=&gt; c --&gt; [a, b, c]
</pre>
<p>
After discussing this we Thomas fixed the test <a href="https://github.com/gettalong/hexapdf/commit/46a3470ac5c3d87853f814bb7d388ec139e02dd3">here</a>. THis sort of
issue can come up surprisingly often when reimplementing languages, or
even updating their standard libraries.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5a19f74" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5a19f74"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> WeakRef</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<code>WeakRef</code> is the sort of class that always has some sort of tight
coupling to the underlying language VM, so it's not surprising that
our implementation was different from MRI's, but it wasn't meant to be
quite as different as it turned out to be. It turns out we had two
problems.
</p>

<p>
The first problem was we had defined <code>WeakRef.new</code>, which meant any
subclass of <code>WeakRef</code> wouldn't produce the expected class. Fixing this
was a fairly simple case of moving our special allocation code to
<code>WeakRef.__allocate__</code>.
</p>

<p>
The second problem turned out to be that our <code>WeakRef</code> implementation
was not a subclass of <code>Delegator</code> which meant it didn't provide
several common methods such as equality checks. Equality checks on
delegated objects are often a little fragile because you can easily
find yourself in the following situation.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">A = Object.new
B = Weakref.new(A)
B == A # true
A == B # false
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you're careful however they will work.
</p>

<p>
This was a slightly hard problem to refactor around. Our core code
knew about the layout of a weak reference object and how to set and
get the object. This meant <code>WeakRef</code> was always loaded whether you
wanted it or not, but that wasn't a huge issue. Refactoring it to have
the correct inheritance meant the core had to know about <code>Delegator</code>
as well, so we either had to move that from the standard library to
our core, or always load a stub which didn't implement any
behaviour. Neither of those options sounded good so we went down a
different route. We refactored our internal weak reference code to
work on any object, we just use a hidden instance variable that cannot
be accessed from Ruby. Now the core doesn't need to know anything
about <code>WeakRef</code> objects, and they can be loaded when you <code>require
'weakref'</code> just like on MRI.
</p>

<p>
Now we've got a more standard implementation of <code>WeakRef</code>, and moved
more of our implementation to Ruby.
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6b4a08d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6b4a08d"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The result of operator assignment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The next problem we hit was the result of operator assignment. Many
languages allow you to transform a statement like
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">a = a + b
</pre>
</div>
<p>
into
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">a += b
</pre>
</div>
<p>
But the situation can become slightly more complicated when the left
hand side may include a method call. For example
</p>
<pre class="example">
a[i3] += 7
</pre>
<p>
Will call <code>[]</code> on <code>a</code> with an argument of 3 to get the existing value,
add 7 to it, call <code>[]=</code> on <code>a</code> with arguments of 7 and the new value,
and then return what? Some languages would say an assignment involving
a method should return the result of that method, but Ruby returns the
newly assigned value <span class="underline">no matter what the method returned</span> We'd never
noticed this because all of our core assignment methods where this had
mattered did return the assigned value, but this wasn't the case in an
LRU cache class in <code>HexaPDF</code>. It's good to have found this one.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org767de0c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org767de0c"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Prepended modules</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Inheritance in Ruby can be bit complex, and although we did do the
right thing when looking up methods but constants didn't work. Not a
complex fix, but it wasn't something we had a test for.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org72e8931" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org72e8931"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Refined modules, <code>Kernel#send</code>, and <code>Symbol#to_proc</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Refined modules are another complex area of Ruby to get
right. <code>Kernel#send</code> is meant to take account of of the refinements
active in its caller's context, and we didn't do that. Fixing this is
a slightly evil
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4ee5f9a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4ee5f9a"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> <code>Module#const_get</code> and autoloading</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Autoloading in Ruby can be complex. Autoloading a single constant may
cause quite a lot to happen, including fundamentally changing the
chain of modules leading to that constant if it is scoped, i.e. has a
qualified name relative to the current module root module. The right
way to do this and match MRI is to resolve each component in turn,
performing any autoloading required. This was complex to get right in
our core Java code so we moved the complex logic to Ruby and only left
the simple cases inn our core.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5551caa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5551caa"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> <code>Array#reject!</code> and throwing errors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
<code>Array#rejects!</code> calls a block passed to with each element of the
array, and removes any for which that block returns true. Sounds
simple doesn't it? Well it would be if you really did all the work to
remove an element as soon as the block told you to, and the ruby
documentation at 2.2 strongly suggests that this is what MRI does.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The array is changed instantly every time the block is called, not
after the iteration is over.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Don't be fooled though as the Ruby documentation doesn't always tell
the truth, and at 2.3 it had changed to the following: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The array may not be changed instantly every time the block is called.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A good way to do this reasonably efficiently is to visit each element
of the array in turn, and move each to its final position if that is
different from it current one. Then when all the elements have been
processed we clear any elements in the storage that are no longer part
of the array and update the length of the array. What happens though
if the block raises an exception, throws to a catch block, or does
something else which would cause <code>Array#reject</code> to exit exceptionally?
Well, the step we forgot was to move any remaining unprocessed array
elements to their final positions before blanking the remaining
space. The result was that we erroneously truncated arrays in certain
cases.
</p>

<p>
Array reject is an interesting example of partially lazy data
structure modification. Ruby uses a bit of this on other array methods
such as <code>shift</code>, and we've implemented techniques to match MRI's
performance characteristic for these methods because there is some
important code out there which depends on them, but there is some very
interesting theoretical work lazy data structures and combining
multiple operations to reduce the total cost, so this is an area we
might revisit in the future.
