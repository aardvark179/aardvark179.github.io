The MRI Ruby implementation supports heavy weight threads which are
pre-emptively scheduled, and lightweight fibres which may run on those
threads and are co-operatively scheduled. Fibres have been a problem
for JVM Ruby implementations because the VM itself did not have a
concept of a fibre, or a lightweight abstraction we could build upon,
but that's starting to change with <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/">Project loom</a>, let's take a look at
what it gives, and how we can use that to implement fibres that can
scale beyond even MRI's.

Everything I"m talking about here is based on early prototypes. The
APIs and features may change radically before anything nears being
production, and there is no fixed timetable for when these feature
will arrive in a production JVM except, "When it's done."

Project Loom is an OpenJDK project with the goal
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To explore and incubate Java VM features and APIs built on top of them
for the implementation of lightweight user-mode threads (fibers),
delimited continuations (of some form), and related features, such as
explicit tail-call.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That may sound complex, but let's look at it bit by bit and see what
it gives us in Java, and how we can use that in TruffleRuby.

<p>
These are currently called <code>java.lang.Fiber</code> in the project loom
prototype, and they provide a nice simple model. Fibres are started
with a scheduler, and whenever the has nothing to do it parks
itself. When the scheduler decided that that fibre has more work it
can do then it will schedule it next. The scheduler isn't special,
it's a standard <code>java.util.concurrent.Executor</code> and it can use
whatever scheduling strategy it likes, across as many threads as it
likes. If your fibres are mostly doing IO, or waiting for locks then
you probably won't even have to park them explicitly as the Java class
library will do that for you.

<h3 id="orgfa39bc1"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Continuations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Continuations are a lower level concept upon which those lightweight
threads are built. A continuation can be run, and can yield control
back to the function which ran it. If it is run again then it will
continue from the point at which it yielded with roughly the same call
stack, local variables, and so forth.

<h3 id="org1e8348d"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> What makes these features more light weight than <code>java.lang.Thread</code>?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
A normal <code>java.lang.Thread</code> in Hotspot is a normal operating system
thread, it has a stack, and will be scheduled by the operating system,
and in the JVM it will include data structures for things like thread
local variables. Scheduling threads is heavyweight because it has to
happen via kernel space and because the kernel only has a very limited
idea of which thread it would be sensible to schedule
next. Lightweight user mode threads and continuations can involve much
less data since we only need to preserve part of the stack, and can
often be very effectively scheduled since the application may often
know precisely what to run next.

<h2 id="org07411c4"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Fibres and continuations in Ruby</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Ruby has its own model of fibres and continuations, and they aren't
quite the same as Loom's
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org826cd38" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org826cd38"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Fibres</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Ruby has the <code>Fiber</code> class. You create a <code>Fiber</code> with a block like this
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">f = Fiber.new do |x|
  puts "Fiber called with #{x}"
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
and call it lie this
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">f.resume(1)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which should produce <code>Fiber called with 1</code> as output. Fibres can
explicitly transfer control to another fibre, or yield to the fibre
which transferred control to them.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf7b5d81" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf7b5d81"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Continuations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Continuations in Ruby are created using the <code>Kernel#callcc</code>
method. This takes a block which will be executed immediately, and
create a continuation object which when called will resume execution
from the end of the block. They are quite hard to get your head round,
so an example is probably helpful. I've adapted this one from the Ruby
documentation on continuations.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-ruby">require "continuation"
def f
  arr = [ "Freddie", "Herbie", "Ron", "Max", "Ringo" ]
  cont = nil
  callcc do |cc| 
    puts 'Creating continuation'
    cont = cc
  end
  puts(message = arr.shift)
  cont.call unless message =~ /Max/
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If you run this Ruby method it will output the following
</p>
<pre class="example">
Creating continuation
Freddie
Herbie
Ron
Max

</pre>
<p>
What's going on here? Well the method creates an array <code>arr</code>, and a
variable <code>cont</code>. It then calls <code>callcc</code> which executes the block,
passing in the continuation object as an argument. The block prints
out that we're creating a continuation, and assigns it to <code>cont</code> so we
can use it later. We then remove the first element of <code>arr</code> and assign
it to <code>message</code> and output it. Finally we call the continuation again
unless <code>message</code> matches "Max", and this causes the latter half of the
method to be run again.
</p>

<p>
There's quite a lot of debate over whether continuations like this are
a good idea, and they certainly aren't widely used in production code,
but they are still part of the standard Ruby implementation and we do
support them in TruffleRuby.
