The MRI Ruby implementation supports heavy weight threads which are
pre-emptively scheduled, and lightweight fibres which may run on those
threads and are co-operatively scheduled. Fibres have been a problem
for JVM Ruby implementations because the VM itself did not have a
concept of a fibre, or a lightweight abstraction we could build upon,
but that's starting to change with <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/">Project loom</a>, let's take a look at
what it gives, and how we can use that to implement fibres that can
scale beyond even MRI's.

Everything I"m talking about here is based on early prototypes. The
APIs and features may change radically before anything nears being
production, and there is no fixed timetable for when these feature
will arrive in a production JVM except, "When it's done."

Project Loom is an OpenJDK project with the goal
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To explore and incubate Java VM features and APIs built on top of them
for the implementation of lightweight user-mode threads (fibers),
delimited continuations (of some form), and related features, such as
explicit tail-call.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That may sound complex, but let's look at it bit by bit and see what
it gives us in Java, and how we can use that in TruffleRuby.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
These are currently called <code>java.lang.Fiber</code> in the project loom
prototype, and they provide a nice simple model. Fibres are started
with a scheduler, and whenever the has nothing to do it parks
itself. When the scheduler decided that that fibre has more work it
can do then it will schedule it next. The scheduler isn't special,
it's a standard <code>java.util.concurrent.Executor</code> and it can use
whatever scheduling strategy it likes, across as many threads as it
likes. If your fibres are mostly doing IO, or waiting for locks then
you probably won't even have to park them explicitly as the Java class
library will do that for you.

<h3 id="orgf16c09c"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Continuations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Continuations are a lower level concept upon which those lightweight
threads are built. A continuation can be run, and can yield control
back to the function which ran it. If it is run again then it will
continue from the point at which it yielded.There is some argument
over nomenclature, and whether what I've described is truly a
continuation or a co-routine, but as we shall see later the
distinction won't be very important in the end as we can build 'true
continuations' from what we have.
