<p>
We think it is crucial that any alternative Ruby implementation aiming
to be fully compatible with MRI runs the C extensions. TruffleRuby's
compatibility was recently significantly improved, with much better
support that almost completely removes the need to patch C extensions.
</p>

<p>
We've been able to support C extensions in TruffleRuby for a long time
now, but we've always had to patch them while building the C for them
to work. We've just added much better support which almost completely
removes the need to patch extensions. In this article I'll explain how
Truffle based languages can support polyglot calls, how C extensions
used to work in TruffleRuby, how they now work, and what the remaining
differences are with MRI.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org1886d89" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1886d89"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Interactions between Truffle languages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
All Truffle languages can provide support for other languages to
access data and make calls by defining how foreign access is
resolved. This covers things like asking if an object is executable,
or has a size, reading and writing public accessible fields, and so
forth. So JavaScript can easily call methods on a Ruby object, or
access members of a Ruby array as long as we provide foreign access
for Ruby objects.
</p>

<p>
There is also support for lower level concepts in the foreign access
APIs.  You can convert an object to a native representation, as well
as checking whether that object can behave like a pointer.
</p>

<p>
These facilities don't cover everything though, so Sulong provides a
set of functions for converting almost any object into a native handle
and back again. I say almost any object because boxed primitives such
as <code>java.lang.Integer</code> are not supported, but you can always arrange
to wrap these in an object that is supported (and unwrap them again
when converting back from handles) to avoid the problem.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org223503f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org223503f"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> C extensions the old way</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
We used Truffle's polyglot features to call C functions from Ruby, and
Ruby methods from C, without touching the arguments at all. This
allowed Ruby objects to pass easily through C code that is interpreted
by Sulong, but fails if those objects have to be passed to a native
shared library or stored on the native heap. To solve that problem we
would patch C extensions in two ways.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge0e571c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge0e571c"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Managed memory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The first way to avoid problems with the translation of Ruby objects to
native pointers is to avoid doing as much as possible. By default we'd
replace every array of <code>VALUE</code> objects (which would be stored on the
native heap) with a managed object that could store the object without
conversion. We could also allocate managed structs instead of native
one, but this became complicated with complex structures which had
nested members of fused arrays.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org90ace5a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org90ace5a"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Handles everywhere</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The second way to solve these problems was to use the functions Sulong
provided to convert between managed objects and native handles. These
functions were hard to use without introducing memory leaks however,
and did require that we patched every point at which a Ruby object
needed to be converted to or from native memory.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3b29ebc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3b29ebc"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Difficult issues with our old approach</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
So, there are a couple of issues with the old approach and resource
leaks. Let's take a look at the behaviour we would like, the problems
we could see with the old approach, and what we could do to fix
those. We'll start by considering a simple case of three objects A, B,
and C. A will be a GC root (i.e. it's either some sort of global
object or a variable which the garbage collector knows cannot be
removed), and B and C are Ruby objects. A will have an instance
variable of B, and B will have one of C. So A has a hard reference to
B and B has a hard reference to C like this.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We'll use red arrows to indicate hard references from now on, and red
boxes to indicate GC roots. The good thing here is that if A stops
being a root, or a hard reference is removed then some or all of the
objects can be collected.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram_gc.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now, what happens when A, B, and C are C structs which have been
wrapped in Ruby objects? Well, now our hard references are just
<code>VALUEs</code> in the structs, and for the GC to know those are alive each
object must mark those it has references to. We'll use purple to mark
marked links.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram2.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
So in this situation if A stops marking B, or B stops marking C, or A
ceases to be a GC root then those objects can be collected, just as
they were above.
</p>

<p>
Now what happens in TruffleRuby when we use handles?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram3.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now we have a problem. The references from A to B, and B to C are weak
(they are simple handle numbers) so the handle table has to associate
those with the objects they represent by keeping a strong
reference. For B or C to be garbage collected we would need to remove
the handle pointing to them. Likewise if A ceases to be a root
something needs to happen for B and C to be collected.
</p>

<p>
We might be able to do that with a finaliser for A which in turn
releases the handle to B, whose finaliser can release the handle to C,
but the situation may not always be so simple. Consider the following
structure of objects.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram4.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is a common sort of structure to find in tools like XML
processors. Each node has a reference to the parent document, and to
its own children. If we break the hard reference from the GC root
object to the document then it and all of its nodes can be
collected. The same is true if the nodes hold <code>VALUEs</code> and mark them,
but what happens if we use handles?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><object type="image/svg+xml" data="diagram5.svg" class="org-svg">
Sorry, your browser does not support SVG.</object>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Well, our diagram has certainly got messier! But it's also hard to
know how we should free those objects nicely. Release the handle that
Object held to Document doesn't help, because other handles exist
pointing to it from the nodes, so the whole cluster remains
uncollected. There doesn't seem to be a nice obvious order in which we
could do it. We could solve almost any situation like this by
introducing weak handles, but that requires patching each C extension,
and carefully analysing how to break these cycles. To really be
compatible we need a different approach.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf9ce310" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf9ce310"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> C extensions the new way</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Our previous approach was enough to get several key C extensions
working, but sometimes they required large patches, and avoiding
resource leaks was tricky. We prototyped several approaches, either
making as many parts as possible managed objects to avoid conversion,
or allowing all Ruby objects to be converted to native pointers, but
both these approaches had issues. So we tried a third approach,
wrapping every Ruby object.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org879c88c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org879c88c"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Wrapping and unwrapping</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
The idea is fairly simple. C extensions will never see raw Ruby
objects, they will only ever see wrappers that know how to convert
themselves to native pointers, and at every point where a Ruby object
needs to be extracted from a wrapper we know there should only ever be
a wrapper or a native pointer. This makes it easy to convert back from
a native pointer to a wrapper. Best of all C extensions don't have to
know this is happening, so although it required a lot of changes to
our C code to wrap and unwrap values that is as far as the changes go.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdf25e32" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdf25e32"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Tidying up wrappers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
It was also important that these wrappers didn't cause the objects
they wrapped to live longer than expected. This was a real problem
with the handle conversion we used to do, and we didn't want to make
it worse. Wrappers obviously need to keep a strong reference to the
object they wrap, and objects should also keep a strong reference to
their wrapper, but converting an object to a native pointer should not
stop it from getting garbage collected at some point, but equally it
mustn't be collected too soon.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1533bee" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1533bee"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Keeping objects alive in MRI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
MRI keeps objects alive in two ways when they are being used in a C
extension. Any object still on the stack will be seen by the GC and
kept alive, but that isn't enough to preserve values which may have
been assigned to a field in a structure. MRI allows these to be
kept alive by associating the structure with a Ruby object, and
allowing that object to mark other it has references to. So, when the
garbage collector traverses all the objects in your Ruby heap it calls
these custom mark functions and the objects will be marked as live as
long as the owners are. There's just one problem, we don't have a GC
which can call custom mark functions, we have to work with any GC on
the JVM. We also can't change the GC to look for native pointers on
the stack which should also keep their respective objects alive.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6a20fd2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6a20fd2"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Periodic marking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
We can solve this by keeping two lists of objects that need to be kept
alive. Then each time we convert a wrapper to a native pointer we will
add the wrapper to the lists, and it will in turn keep its object
alive. One list is for those objects with pointers on the stack. We
can create this list whenever we enter a C extension, and destroy it
again when we finish the call. The other list is a fixed size buffer
of every wrapper converted to a pointer. Whenever this list becomes
full we'll run any marking functions associated with live objects and
attach lists of marked objects to their owners.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
I said at the start of this article that we used to have to patch C
extensions, so how much has our compatibility improved; does this new
approach perform well or is more work required to make it fast; and
what are our next steps?

<h3 id="orga141c62"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Compatibility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/commit/1915b9a4">130 additions, and 1,402 deletions</a> is the best kind of commit to be
able to merge. This new approach has allowed us to remove almost
all our patches for C extensions, even for complex ones such as zlib,
OpenSSl, or pg.
</p>

<p>
Notice we've only removed <i>almost</i> all patches. There are however
still some fundamental differences between us and MRI, but they are
much smaller than they were.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5d6af74" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5d6af74"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.1</span> The type of <code>VALUE</code></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">
<p>
One is that our <code>VALUE</code> type is a <code>void *</code> in C. This means we can't
do a switch on a <code>VALUE</code>, so we do still need to patch anything that
tries to do that.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">
<p>
We also can't yet translate a pointer to a Ruby array's contents to
native. This requires storing the contents in native memory so that
they can be read and altered from C, but ensuring that the view of the
array from Ruby remains consistent with any changes made via a C
extension. The work to support this is in progress and we expect to
resolve this area of incompatibility very soon.

<h4 id="orgd81ac36"><span class="section-number-4">5.1.3</span> Calling functions with the wrong arguments</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-3">
<p>
There are also some small differences imposed by our use of Sulong to
interpret C extensions. One is function declarations may need to be
changed. For example a function declared as taking two arguments must
be passed two arguments, even if the second one is never used, and
<code>int</code> and pointer types may not be as interchangeable as they can be
in native C. We also have trouble with varargs functions in managed
code being called from native libraries, but none of these differences
causes widespread problems and most can be patched without changing the
behaviour of any C extensions.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7a09b41" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7a09b41"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Performance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Translating between Ruby objects and native pointers requires updating
a global hash table, which is relatively expensive. We reduce that
cost by tagging the pointers for common types, so true, false, nil,
and so forth always convert to the same native value and never need to
touch the hash table. Likewise fixnums can be tagged to cover most of
their range, and we can probably use a similar technique for floating
point numbers.
</p>

<p>
We are also doing work to reduce the costs of our GC marking
technique. We can make an assumptions that GC marking functions are
not used and avoid those costs as long as we can safely recover as
soon as markers are introduced, and we can reduce the cost of
preserving objects on the stack in many situations.
</p>

<p>
Having applied some of these techniques we have benchmarked repeated
calls to C extensions being up to 3 times faster than MRI 2.4 in some
cases, though not yet for all our tests. We'll continue to work no
performance in this area.

<p>
As I mentioned above we're still working on some changes to improve
compatibility even more, and we'll continue to benchmark and improve
performance. We expect any remaining problems to be related to
specific functions in the Ruby C APIs rather than being more
fundamental compatibility issues, and we'll be expanding our testing
of gems considerably in the near future to help find and resolve
these.
