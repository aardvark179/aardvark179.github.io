I've been looking at the performance of the [[https://github.com/puma/puma][Puma]] websever recently,
and it's clear we need to fix a few things.
* Thread pools and work queues
** The Puma thread pool design
** Testing with a minimal task
What's the smallest task you could submit to a thread pool? One that
does nothing! Doing this we should be able to see how much time it
takes the pool to process the tasks. To test this I wrote a benchmark
that submitted 100000 tasks to the thread pool and timed how long that
took. It's slightly more complex than that as I have to wait for the
pool to not be full before submitting more tasks, but it's still very
simple code.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
class TestTask
  def run
  end
end

MAX_THREADS = (ENV['MAX_THREADS'] || '8').to_i

THREAD_POOL = Puma::ThreadPool.new(0, MAX_THREADS, Object) do | task, thing |
  task.run
end

def test
  100_000.times {
    THREAD_POOL << TestTask.new
    THREAD_POOL.wait_until_not_full
  }
end
#+END_SRC
The test is run twenty times for warmup, and another twenty for taking
the actual measurements. I also ran the benchmark different numbers of
max threads in the thread pool from 1 to 16. The results for MRI and
TruffleRuby were as follows:
